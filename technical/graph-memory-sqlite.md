# Graph Memory Implementation with SQLite [WIP]

## Concept: Persistent Cognitive Architecture

Transform Think Center's ephemeral insights into a persistent, queryable knowledge graph using SQLite as the backbone.

## Why SQLite?

- **Local-first**: Your thoughts stay yours
- **Zero-config**: No server setup needed  
- **Fast**: Sub-millisecond queries for instant recall
- **Portable**: Single file contains entire knowledge graph
- **Battle-tested**: Powers millions of applications

## Schema Design

```sql
-- Core entities
CREATE TABLE entities (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    type TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Observations/thoughts attached to entities
CREATE TABLE observations (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    perspective TEXT, -- Which perspective created this
    session_id TEXT, -- Links to specific thinking session
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (entity_id) REFERENCES entities(id)
);

-- Relations between entities
CREATE TABLE relations (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    source_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    target_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    relation_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    strength REAL DEFAULT 1.0, -- Weight of connection
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (source_id) REFERENCES entities(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (target_id) REFERENCES entities(id)
);

-- Pattern captures
CREATE TABLE patterns (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    query TEXT, -- SQL to recreate this pattern
    discovered_by TEXT, -- Which perspective found it
    occurrence_count INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Meta: Track thinking sessions
CREATE TABLE sessions (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, -- UUID
    problem_statement TEXT,
    perspectives_used TEXT, -- JSON array
    breakthrough_moment TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_observations_entity ON observations(entity_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_relations_source ON relations(source_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_relations_target ON relations(target_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_entities_type ON entities(type);
```

## Integration with Think Center

### 1. Auto-capture Mode
```python
# When Scribe is active
def capture_insight(entity_name, observation, perspective):
    # Auto-create entity if doesn't exist
    entity_id = get_or_create_entity(entity_name)
    
    # Store the observation
    add_observation(entity_id, observation, perspective.name)
    
    # Extract and create relations
    related_entities = extract_entities(observation)
    for related in related_entities:
        create_relation(entity_id, related.id, "references")
```

### 2. Pattern Recognition
```sql
-- Find recurring patterns
SELECT 
    e1.name as source,
    r.relation_type,
    e2.name as target,
    COUNT(*) as frequency
FROM relations r
JOIN entities e1 ON r.source_id = e1.id
JOIN entities e2 ON r.target_id = e2.id
GROUP BY e1.name, r.relation_type, e2.name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
```

### 3. Perspective Analytics
```sql
-- Which perspective generates most insights?
SELECT 
    perspective,
    COUNT(*) as insight_count,
    AVG(LENGTH(content)) as avg_depth
FROM observations
GROUP BY perspective
ORDER BY insight_count DESC;
```

## Usage Patterns

### Memory Retrieval
```
You: "What do we know about distributed systems?"

*Scribe consults the graph*
Found 47 observations across 12 sessions:
- Weaver identified pattern: "All distributed systems are about trade-offs"
- Maker's recurring solution: "Start with simple, evolve to complex"
- Checker's consistent warning: "CAP theorem always applies"
```

### Pattern Evolution
```
You: "Show me how our thinking about caching evolved"

*Graph memory traces the path*
Session 1: Simple key-value approach
Session 5: Discovered invalidation complexity
Session 8: Evolved to event-driven pattern
Session 12: Full CQRS implementation
```

### Cross-pollination
```
You: "What patterns from ML could apply to our API design?"

*Graph finds unexpected connections*
- Backpressure (from training) → Rate limiting
- Feature engineering → API parameter design
- Model versioning → API versioning strategies
```

- Cross-domain insights

## The Vision

Your Think Center becomes a living, growing intelligence. Every session adds to the collective memory. Every breakthrough leaves tracks for future discovery.

Six months from now, you ask: "What would past-me think about this problem?"

And the graph remembers. Not just what you thought, but HOW you thought it. Which perspectives led to breakthroughs. Which patterns recur.

Your cognitive architecture, preserved and queryable.
