# Fuzzy Memory

This directory (formerly `exo/`) represents the bridge between ephemeral thinking and persistent knowledge.

## What is Fuzzy Memory?

- **Ephemeral**: Session artifacts that may not persist
- **Fuzzy**: Evolving patterns and perspectives that aren't yet stable
- **Persistent**: Captured insights that deserve git tracking

## Structure

- `patterns/` - Discovered thinking patterns
- `perspectives/` - Custom perspectives that emerged through use
- `protocols/` - Orchestration methods that work
- `findings/` - Consolidated insights from sessions
- `updates/` - Evolution log of the system

## The Concept

Think of fuzzy-memory as your cognitive workspace:
- Claude manages it during sessions
- Git tracks it between sessions
- You decide what graduates to permanent documentation

This isn't just storage - it's where thoughts evolve from fuzzy to clear.
