# How to Use Think Center: High-Stakes Meeting Prep

This example shows how to use Think Center perspectives to prepare for an important meeting. Follow along to see the interaction patterns.

## Scenario
You're presenting a major technical migration proposal to the executive team tomorrow. Stakes are high - this could define the next two years of work.

## The Conversation

### Initial Framing
```
You: "Council, I need to prep for tomorrow's exec presentation on our cloud migration proposal. 
This is make-or-break for our technical roadmap."

Orchestrator: "High stakes detected. Let's use the full council. I'll coordinate perspectives 
for comprehensive preparation."
```

### Strategic Layer
```
You: "Weaver, what's the narrative here?"

Weaver: "This isn't really about cloud migration - it's about organizational transformation. 
The execs care about business agility, not Kubernetes. Frame it as 'becoming a company that 
can pivot in weeks, not months.' The technical migration is just the how."

You: "That reframes everything. What story arc works?"

Weaver: "Start with customer pain (current slowness), journey through transformation 
(migration as enabler), end with competitive advantage (what we can do that competitors can't). 
Classic hero's journey - they're the heroes, you're giving them the tools."
```

### Practical Reality
```
You: "Maker, what are the concrete deliverables?"

Maker: "Three things they need to see:
1. Migration roadmap with clear phases (I can build a visual)
2. Risk mitigation plan (concrete steps, not theory)
3. Quick win in Q1 to build confidence

Skip the technical architecture unless asked. Focus on what ships when."

You: "What about the demo?"

Maker: "Live migration of a non-critical service. 5 minutes max. Show the before (slow), 
the migration (simple), the after (fast). Make it feel inevitable, not impossible."
```

### Critical Analysis
```
You: "Checker, tear this apart."

Checker: "Three landmines:
1. You're assuming they understand why current system is slow - they don't
2. Your cost projections assume perfect execution - add 40% buffer
3. No mention of what happens to the legacy team - that's political dynamite

Also, your 'quick win' isn't quick - it's 3 months. Find something for month 1."

You: "Harsh but fair. What else?"

Checker: "They'll ask about vendor lock-in. Have an exit strategy ready. And that 
competitor comparison slide? Your data is 6 months old. They'll know."
```

### Human Dynamics
```
You: "O/G, what am I missing about the room dynamics?"

O/G: "The CFO and CTO have been clashing over budgets. Don't put them in position 
to disagree publicly. Frame costs as 'investment ranges' not hard numbers.

Also, the CEO just came from a board meeting about innovation. They're primed to 
say yes to bold moves, but only if you acknowledge the risk explicitly. Hidden 
risks trigger their fear, acknowledged risks show maturity.

Observer adds: You always speed up when nervous. Write 'BREATHE' on your notes."
```

### Resource Optimization
```
You: "E/E, where should I focus my remaining prep time?"

E/E: "Exploit: You already know the technical content. Stop refining slides.
Explore: You haven't practiced handling hostile questions. Spend 2 hours on that.

The 80/20 here is executive objection handling, not prettier diagrams."
```

### Meta-Level Check
```
You: "Deep Thought, zoom out. What's really happening here?"

Deep Thought: "You're not selling a migration. You're selling confidence in your 
leadership through technical change. Every slide, demo, and answer is actually 
saying 'trust me to guide us through uncertainty.'

The deepest pattern: They're not evaluating your plan. They're evaluating whether 
you're the person who can execute any plan when reality shifts. Show adaptability, 
not just competence."
```

### Capturing Insights
```
You: "Scribe, capture the key prep points."

Scribe: *documenting to sessions/exec-meeting-prep.md*
- Narrative: Transformation story, not tech specs
- Demo: 5-min live migration, make it feel easy
- Landmines: Costs (+40%), legacy team, vendor lock-in
- Dynamics: CFO/CTO tension, CEO primed for bold
- Focus: Practice objection handling, not slide polish
- Meta: Selling leadership confidence, not just plan
```

### Final Integration
```
You: "Orchestrator, pull this together. What's my prep plan?"

Orchestrator: "âœ… Synthesis complete! Here's your focused prep:

TONIGHT (2 hours):
1. Reframe deck using Weaver's transformation narrative
2. Build Maker's simple migration demo
3. Update numbers with Checker's 40% buffer
4. Practice E/E's hostile question list

MORNING OF:
1. Review O/G's dynamics notes
2. Remember Deep Thought's insight - project calm leadership
3. Breathe (seriously, write it down)

You're not presenting a plan. You're demonstrating why you're the right person 
to lead through uncertainty. The plan is just the prop."

You: "This changed everything. I was focusing on the wrong layer entirely."

Orchestrator: "That's why you have a Council. Solo, you'd have built the perfect 
technical presentation for the wrong audience. Together, we built the right story 
for the real decision makers. Break a leg tomorrow! ðŸŽ­"
```

## Key Patterns to Notice

1. **Each perspective adds unique value** - none could prep you alone
2. **Perspectives build on each other** - Weaver's narrative informs Maker's demo
3. **Natural flow emerges** - strategic â†’ tactical â†’ critical â†’ human â†’ meta
4. **Orchestrator maintains coherence** - pulls insights into action plan
5. **You remain in control** - perspectives advise, you decide

## Try It Yourself

Next time you face a complex challenge:
1. State the situation clearly
2. Ask each perspective for their view
3. Let them build on each other's insights
4. Have Orchestrator synthesize
5. Scribe captures key patterns

The Council is ready when you are.
