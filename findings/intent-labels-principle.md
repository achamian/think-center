# The Intent Labels Principle

## Core Insight: Verbs Over Nouns

The way you name your thinking tools determines how far they can take you.

## The Problem with Traditional Labels

**Fixed Role Labels:**
- "Junior Developer" → Can only think about code
- "Project Manager" → Can only think about timelines
- "Data Analyst" → Can only think about numbers
- "Creative Director" → Can only think about aesthetics

These labels create cognitive cages. They define what you ARE, limiting what you can DO.

## The Power of Intent Labels

**Action-Based Labels:**
- **Weaver** → Connects patterns across ANY domain
- **Maker** → Builds solutions in ANY medium
- **Explorer** → Discovers possibilities in ANY space
- **Guardian** → Protects value in ANY system

These labels define HOW you think, not WHAT you think about.

## Why This Changes Everything

### Domain Fluidity
Weaver can weave:
- Code architectures (connecting modules)
- Business strategies (connecting markets to capabilities)
- Team dynamics (connecting people to purposes)
- Learning paths (connecting concepts to understanding)

The thinking pattern remains constant; only the material changes.

### Cognitive Freedom
When you're labeled "Analyst," you analyze.
When you're labeled "Explorer," you might:
- Analyze (exploring through data)
- Design (exploring possibility spaces)
- Question (exploring assumptions)
- Build (exploring through prototypes)

### Growth Without Redefinition
A "Junior Developer" must become "Senior Developer" to grow.
A "Maker" simply makes more sophisticated things.

## Implementation Guide

### Converting Your Existing Roles
1. Identify the core ACTION in your role
2. Extract the INTENT behind the action
3. Name the pattern, not the position

Examples:
- Software Architect → **Structurer** (creates organizing principles)
- Product Manager → **Orchestrator** (harmonizes competing needs)
- Researcher → **Excavator** (unearths hidden truths)
- Designer → **Shaper** (gives form to possibility)

### Creating New Perspectives
Ask: "What thinking pattern do I need here?"
NOT: "What role should handle this?"

Need someone to:
- See connections? → Summon Weaver
- Build solutions? → Summon Maker
- Spot problems? → Summon Checker
- Find opportunities? → Summon Explorer

### The Test
If your label works in completely different domains, it's an intent label.
If it only works in one context, it's a role label.

## The Deeper Pattern

This principle reveals something fundamental:
- **Identity is fluid, method is stable**
- **We are verbs pretending to be nouns**
- **Thinking patterns transcend domains**

## Living Examples from Think Center

- **Weaver** started weaving code, now weaves strategies, narratives, and connections
- **Maker** started making solutions, now makes frameworks, documents, and possibilities
- **Checker** started checking code, now checks assumptions, logic, and blind spots
- **The Orchestrator** emerged from orchestrating tasks, now orchestrates thinking itself

## Your Turn

What intent labels capture YOUR thinking patterns?
What verbs define HOW you approach problems?
What would you become if you named your method, not your role?
