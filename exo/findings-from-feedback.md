# Consolidated Feedback Findings

## From Working with Claude Desktop.md

### Feedback 1: MCP Server Improvements ‚úÖ
- **Business Value**: Each MCP server should state its purpose
  - Filesystem: Source of truth for exo and artifacts
  - Git: Version control for memories and artifacts
- **Structure**: Split each MCP configuration into separate subsections
- **New Servers to Add**:
  - Perplexity AI MCP - For research (update boot.md to mention this)
  - Brave Search MCP - For local searches
  - Command line MCP - For developers
- **Note**: Use trusted sources only (past open source contributions)

### Feedback 2: Workflow Capture ‚úÖ
- Capture the ‚úÖ/‚ùå workflow pattern for interacting with MD files
- This workflow will evolve in future

### Feedback 3: MCP Config Path ‚úÖ
- Corrected macOS path to `/Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

## From 2024-evolution-patterns.md

### Feedback 4: Relocate and Restructure ‚úÖ
- **Move to**: New directory `think-center/findings`
- **New Structure**:
  1. Split Brain Experiment - key concept - link to 'Learnings from Split Brain Experiment'
  2. A/B Aha moment - key concept - link to 'A/B Findings.md'
  3. Importance of humor - key concept - link to 'Humor builds trust'
  4. HYPOTHESIS: How new perspectives can be created? - Explain how thought routines with meta observer lead to new perspectives

## From graph-memory-sqlite.md

### Feedback 5: Mark as WIP ‚úÖ
- Add WIP (Work In Progress) marker to the document

## From evolution-findings.md

### Feedback 6: Create Linked Files ‚úÖ
- Created `split-brain-learnings.md` based on `/Users/niranjan/dev/claudspace/split-brain-discovery.md`
- Created `ab-findings.md` based on `/Users/niranjan/dev/claudspace/ab-discovery.md`
- Created `humor-builds-trust.md` based on `/Users/niranjan/dev/claudspace/thought-evolution-collection/core-discoveries/04-importance-of-humor.md`

## Action Items

1. [x] Update Working with Claude Desktop.md with MCP improvements
2. [x] Create workflow capture document for MD interaction pattern
3. [x] Create findings directory and restructure evolution patterns
4. [x] Mark graph-memory-sqlite.md as WIP
5. [x] Update README with links to findings
6. [x] Correct MCP config path for macOS
7. [x] Create three linked findings documents from claudespace sources

## From evolution-findings.md (Round 2)

### Feedback 7: Additional Hypotheses ‚úÖ
- Added Hypothesis 4.5: Intent Labels Enable Domain Expansion
  - Explains why "Weaver" works better than "Junior Dev"
  - Shows how intent-based labels allow infinite domain expansion
- Added Hypothesis 5: L4 Meta Observer Generates New Insights
  - Describes the recursive insight generation through meta-observation levels
  - Shows how watching the watcher creates new principles
- Added Hypothesis 6: Genesis Creates the Right Environment
  - Explains why genesis.md's emotional foundation enables the technical framework
  - Shows how relational grounding makes perspectives come alive

## From Follow-up Discussion

### Feedback 8: Boundary Conditions & Evidence Base ‚úÖ
- Added "Boundary Conditions & Open Questions" section to evolution-findings.md
- Acknowledged limited evidence base, positioned as hypotheses not laws
- Added measurement guidance (experiential, user logs via Scribe)
- Included open questions for users to explore
- Added "Reality as Judge" philosophy

### Feedback 9: Intent Labels Amplification ‚úÖ
- Created dedicated `intent-labels-principle.md` for deeper exploration
- Added practical conversion guide from roles to intent labels
- Included living examples and implementation patterns
- Linked from main evolution findings for prominence
