# Session: Think Center Structure Evolution
Date: 2024-01-20 11:00
Context: Evolved directory structure after exo → fuzzy-memory rename
Perspectives Used: Weaver, Maker, Scribe

## Challenge/Question
How should we organize different types of thinking artifacts? The fuzzy-memory rename revealed need for clearer structure.

## Key Insights

1. **Memory isn't monolithic** - Different types serve different purposes:
   - Episodic (sessions): What happened when
   - Procedural (collaborations): How we work together
   - Semantic (fuzzy-memory): What we've learned

2. **Staging area crucial** - Need active exchange zone for feedback cycles

3. **Natural progression**:
   ```
   Raw session → Collaboration → Pattern → Finding
   ```

## Decisions Made

- Created three-tier structure: sessions/, collaborations/, fuzzy-memory/
- Added staging/ under collaborations for active exchanges
- Separated chronological logs from extracted patterns
- Each directory has clear purpose and README

## Follow-up

- Document example workflows in each area
- Create templates for common interaction patterns
- Consider automation for pattern extraction

## Scribe Notes

*Pattern observed*: Structure emerged from use, not planning. The need for staging became obvious during feedback cycles. This mirrors the A/B discovery - let function define form.

*Meta-insight*: The directory structure itself is a perspective on how thinking evolves. By making it explicit, we make the implicit process visible and repeatable.
