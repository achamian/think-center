# Sessions

Your thinking history lives here.

## What Goes Here

Chronological logs of your Think Center sessions:
- Morning task lists and their execution
- Problem-solving sessions with timestamps
- Breakthrough moments worth preserving
- Evolution of thinking on specific topics

## Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md`

Examples:
- `2024-01-20-morning-tasks.md`
- `2024-01-20-api-design-session.md`
- `2024-01-20-breakthrough-on-caching.md`

## Why Keep Session Logs?

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Scribe can identify recurring themes
2. **Progress Tracking**: See how your thinking evolves
3. **Knowledge Mining**: Past sessions contain forgotten gems
4. **Meta-Learning**: Discover your best thinking conditions

## Integration with Fuzzy-Memory

When patterns emerge across multiple sessions, they graduate to `/fuzzy-memory/patterns/`.
