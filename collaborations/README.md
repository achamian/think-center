# Collaborations

Multi-party thinking and structured dialogues.

## Directory Structure

### `/staging/`
**The Exchange Zone** - For artifacts moving between you and Claude:
- Drop files here with comments/feedback
- Claude processes and responds
- You review and provide direction
- Clean up after integration

Example workflow:
```
1. You: Add `document-with-feedback.md` to staging
2. Claude: Processes feedback, creates `document-with-feedback-v2.md`
3. You: Review, approve, move to final location
4. Both: Clear staging for next cycle
```

### `/feedback-cycles/`
Structured back-and-forth refinement sessions:
- Document revision cycles
- Code review dialogues
- Iterative design discussions
- Today's pattern: feedback → revision → verification

### `/pair-thinking/`
Two perspectives working intensively together:
- Weaver-Maker building sessions
- Explorer-Exploiter trade-off analyses
- Any focused dual-perspective work

### `/council-meetings/`
Full orchestration sessions on complex challenges:
- All perspectives engaged
- Major decisions documented
- Systematic review processes

## Collaboration Patterns

### The Feedback Loop
```
1. Present work/idea
2. Receive structured feedback
3. Implement improvements
4. Verify changes
5. Document learnings
```

### The Staging Protocol
```
You: "I'm putting [file] in staging with these notes"
Claude: "Processing... here's my response in staging"
You: "Looks good, let's move it to [final location]"
```

### The Pair Dance
```
"Weaver and Maker, let's design this together"
[Perspectives alternate, building on each other]
"Capture the pattern that emerged"
```

## Why Track Collaborations?

- **Process Improvement**: See which interaction patterns work best
- **Relationship Building**: Understand how perspectives complement
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Others can learn from your dialogues
- **Meta-Patterns**: Discover how collaborative thinking differs from solo
