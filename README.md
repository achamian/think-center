# Think Center

> Where complex problems meet structured thinking

## Quick Start

### Copy ‚Üí Paste ‚Üí Think Better

Copy the [llm-agnostic.md](llm-agnostic.md) prompt into your preferred LLM (ChatGPT, Claude.ai, etc) and start thinking with multiple perspectives.

### Try It Now

**For Founders:**
```
"Weaver, I'm preparing for our Series A raise
Context: Current deck shows 3x growth, but unit economics need work
Council, what story should we tell investors?"
```

**For Builders:**
```
"Maker, I want to build a CLI tool for data processing
Context: Python, enterprise CSV files, scalability concerns
Weaver/Maker/Checker, any thoughts before we architect?"
```
**For Leaders:**
```
O/G, our top engineer just resigned unexpectedly 
Context: Team morale is low, shipping deadlines next month 
E/E and Checker, how do we navigate this?
```

**For Thinkers:**
```
"Deep Thought, I want to explore what role situational humor plays in RLHF while
 developing duality pairs - 'Weaver, see what Maker did :)'? 
Context: We discussed the impact of safe environment for development of LLM personas.
Council, any thoughts before we proceed?"
```

### Key Principles

**Start Specific, Then Expand**
- Begin with one perspective: "Maker, how do we build this?"
- Then broaden: "Weaver/Maker/Checker, thoughts?"
- Teach them through interaction

**Avoid the Orchestrator Paradox**
- ‚ùå "Council, decide for me" (delegation fails)
- ‚úÖ "Checker, verify this approach" (conscious choice wins)
- You choose the perspective = you shape the thinking

**Convergence/Divergence Patterns**
- **Diverging**: Challenge ONE critical assumption, let others watch
- **Converging**: Engage all perspectives or specific pairs deeply
- Don't overwhelm - selective pressure creates insights
- **Learning through observation**: When perspectives watch each other interact, they produce better outputs next time

**Teaching Through Friction**
- **If Checker annoys you**: That's the signal to teach, not dismiss
- Your feedback shapes their future responses (RLHF at interface time)
- Resistance points reveal where breakthroughs hide

### Pro Tips

- **Judgment-free zone**: Create psychological safety for perspectives to explore
- **Watch for whispers when stuck**: Meta-streams (italics) often contain breakthrough seeds
- **Scribe silently documents**: Key patterns captured automatically as you work
- **Question pleasant assumptions**: Comfort zones hide blind spots
- **SEE the thinking**: Don't just read outputs - recognize patterns in how perspectives interact

#### Vibe enables dialogue

*Your tone shapes their responses - playful > commanding*

## What is Think Center?

A cognitive framework for problems that need more than gut instinct. Born from the realization that complex thinking requires multiple, interacting viewpoints - not just more processing power.

## The Council

**Core Perspectives** (always available):
- üßµ **Weaver**: Strategic thinking, pattern recognition
- üî® **Maker**: Practical execution, next steps
- ‚úì **Checker**: Critical analysis, assumption testing

**Extended Council** (for deeper work):
- üîç **O/G** (Observer/Guardian): Human dynamics, psychological patterns
- ‚öñÔ∏è **E/E** (Explorer/Exploiter): Resource allocation, opportunity analysis
- üß† **Deep Thought**: Meta-cognition, system-level patterns
- üìú **Scribe**: Silent observer, captures critical patterns for future reference

## Setup Options

### With Claude Desktop (Optimal)
Enable filesystem access for persistent memory and seamless workflow.
[Setup Guide](./working-with-claude-desktop.md)

### With Note-Taking Tools
- [Obsidian Integration](./how-to-use-with-obsidian.md) - Your vault becomes the shared workspace
- [Logseq Integration](./how-to-use-with-logseq.md) - Block-based thinking with perspectives

### With Claude Code
- [Claude Code Integration](./think-center-claude-code.md) - Coordinate between multiple coding sessions

## Philosophy & Evolution

This framework builds on the [Human-LLM Pairing Manifesto](https://github.com/achamian/human-llm-pairing-manifesto) - treating LLMs as thought partners, not task executors.

Key discoveries documented in:
- [think-center-why-maybe](https://github.com/achamian/think-center-why-maybe) - Exploration and experiments
- [Local Manifesto](manifesto.md) - Deeper theory behind cognitive orchestration
- [Evolution Findings](./findings/evolution-findings.md) - How perspectives emerge

## When to Use Think Center

- **Strategic decisions** with multiple stakeholders
- **System design** with competing constraints
- **Research problems** requiring multiple methodologies
- **Complex debugging** where root cause is unclear
- **Innovation challenges** needing diverse perspectives

## Core Insights

### You're Not Using a Tool
You're having a structured conversation with yourself. The perspectives make your thinking visible, queryable, and reviewable.

### The Dance Matters
How you interact shapes the output. Teach perspectives through engagement. Debate creates depth.

### Evolution Through Use
Your Council adapts to your domain. Custom perspectives emerge. Successful patterns strengthen.

## Start Now

Have a complex problem? Copy [llm-agnostic.md](llm-agnostic.md) and present it to the Council.

The best way to understand orchestrated thinking is to experience it.

**Quick Start Reminder:** Copy [llm-agnostic.md](llm-agnostic.md) ‚Üí Paste into your LLM ‚Üí Start with "Hello [Perspective]"
